**Hill diversity** can be expressed as the **mean species rarity:** $D=[\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i(r_i)^ℓ]^\\frac{1}{ℓ}$, 

where $S =$ total number of species, $p_i =$ relative abundance of species $i$, $r_i =$ rarity  of species $i$, $\\frac{1}{p_i}$, and $ℓ$ is the control parameter that scales the rarity axis.

In this program $D$ is shown as the fulcrum of the lever. The <span style="color:#7570b3"> arithmetic</span>, <span style="color:#d95f02"> geometric</span>, and <span style="color:#1b9e77">harmonic</span> means are included as reference points for each scale.
